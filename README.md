#### ‚ùì How I came up with this project.
This project is for Tech with Tim's Code Jam, where we were ask to create an application based on the theme **"Health"**. This was my first time entering a code jam and it was pretty challenging for me. I then came up with the idea of making just a website where they can explore different kinds of vitamins and benefits, but thought that it would be too bland and boring. This made me scroll through the internet and suddenly saw a mood tracker on a notebook. So, I went and digitalize the idea.
